## Overview

`eventStudy` is an R package for performing event studies. It has many capabilites:

- It maximizes sample size by using a "stacked" approach to match all possible control observations to any given treatment observation at any event time;
- It allows the estimated treatment effects to vary over time and by treatment cohort. It can also impose a common treatment effect across cohorts (extending results by Abraham and Sun, 2018);
- It has built-in tools to correct for anticipation (extending results by Fadlon & Nielsen, 2018) and deviations from parallel trends (either using covariate balancing in the spirit of Abadie, 2003, or modeling parametric deviations from parallel trends).

We wrote a practical guide to event studies that explains all of the identification and estimation issues [available here](https://github.com/setzler/eventStudy/blob/master/guide/event_study_guide.pdf). 


The latest version of the package can be installed with the command `devtools::install_github("setzler/eventStudy")`.

## The `ES` command

The event study is performed by the `ES` command.

### Required Arguments of the `ES` command:

These commands simply supply `ES` your data and tell `ES` the names of your variables:

- `long_data`: This is the data in long format (e.g., each row corresponds to a household in a given calendar year). It must be a data.table.
- `outcomevar`: This is the outcome of interest. It must be a `character`.
- `unit_var`: This is the individual. It must be a `character`.
- `cal_time_var`: This is the calendar time variable (e.g., year). It must be a `character`.
- `onset_time_var`: This is the time at which the observation is treated. It must be a `character`.
- `cluster_vars`: These are the variables used to cluster standard errors (e.g., setting it to the same variable as `unit_var` is a common choice).

### Optional Arguments of the `ES` command:

These commands allow you to customize the event study to deal with issues like anticipation and non-parallel trends:

- `omitted_event_time`: This lets you decide the pre-treatment event time to use as the reference year. It must be an integer that is less than or equal to `-1`. The default is `-2`.
- `min_control_gap`: This is the minimum number of time periods ahead that a cohort must receive treatment in order to be included in the control group (e.g., Fadlon & Nielsen, 2018, use `min_control_gap=5`). It must be an integer that is at least `1`. The default is `1`.
- `max_control_gap`: Like `min_control_gap`, but for the maximum number of time periods ahead  (e.g., Fadlon & Nielsen, 2018, use `max_control_gap=5`). It must be an integer that is at least as large as `min_control_gap`. The default is `Inf`.
- `control_subset_var` and `control_subset_event_time`: These variables allow one to require that the control group  satisfies a logical condition at a given event time. `control_subset_var` must be the name of a logical variable in the data (all values of this variable are `TRUE` or `FALSE`) and `control_subset_event_time` is an integer which specifies the event time at which the control group must have a value of `TRUE` on `control_subset_var`. The default is `control_subset_var=NA`, which bypasses this option.
- `fill_zeros` and `vars_to_fill`: `fill_zeros` is a logical indicator (`TRUE` or `FALSE`) which results in the data being filled for all observations that are missing. If an individual (`unit_var`) does not have a row of data for some calendar time (`cal_time_var`), such a row will be created when `fill_zeros=TRUE`. The outcome variable will have a missing value `NA` for any created rows. `vars_to_fill` is a `character` vector of variable names for which `NA` should be replaced by `0`. This is useful if missing data indicates that the true value of the outcome is zero (in this case, set `fill_zeros=TRUE` and `vars_to_fill` should include the `outcomevar`).


## Plotting the results

- `ES_plot_levels` will plot the levels across event times for the treated and control cohorts.
- `ES_plot_ATTs` will plot the treatment effects across event times. By default, it will plot heterogeneous effects for each cohort; set `homogeneous_only = TRUE` to only plot the pooled effect under the homogeneity assumption.
