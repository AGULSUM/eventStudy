Parameter of interest:

 We are interested in the average treatment on the treated, which is 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathrm{ATT}_{t}\left(e\right)\equiv\mathbb{E}\left[Y_{it}\left(e\right)-Y_{it}\left(\infty\right)\big|E_{it}=e\right]$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $Y_{it}\left(\infty\right)$
\end_inset

 is the outcome an 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 would have at 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 if counterfactually assigned treatment at time 
\begin_inset Formula $\infty$
\end_inset

 (i.e., never treated).
 This is the average difference in 
\begin_inset Formula $Y_{it}$
\end_inset

 that is due to being treated at 
\begin_inset Formula $e$
\end_inset

 instead of 
\begin_inset Formula $\infty$
\end_inset

, among those who are treated at 
\begin_inset Formula $e$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Example 1 (FN): 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{E}\left[Y_{it}\left(1995\right)-Y_{it}\left(\infty\right)\big|E_{it}=1995\right]$
\end_inset

 is the difference in labor supply at, say, time 
\begin_inset Formula $t=1997$
\end_inset

 for a wife whose husband died in 1995 versus if her husband had never died.

 This says that, for any two observed cohorts 
\begin_inset Formula $e$
\end_inset

\end_inset

 the same.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Example 1 (FN): Parallel trends requires that, for wives whose husbands
 died in 1995 and wives whose husbands died in 2000, if none of their husbands
 had died, they would have experienced the same change in mean labor supply
 between 1995 and 1996.

 This says that, prior to the onset of treatment, outcomes do not depend
 on the time at which treatment will occur.

 Here, we consider the model with 
\begin_inset Formula $Y_{t}^{\infty}=0.75-0.005\left(t-1990\right),\forall t$
\end_inset

 for the 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{i}=2000$
\end_inset

 cohort, and 
\begin_inset Formula $Y_{t}^{\infty}=0.70-0.005\left(t-1990\right),\forall t$
\end_inset

 for the 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{i}=1995$
\end_inset

 cohort.
 Clearly, this satisfies the Parallel Trends assumption, since 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{E}\left[Y_{is}\left(\infty\right)-Y_{it}\left(\infty\right)\big|E_{i}=1995\right]=\mathbb{E}\left[Y_{is}\left(\infty\right)-Y_{it}\left(\infty\right)\big|E_{i}=2000\right]=0.005\left(t-s\right)$
\end_inset

.
 In Figure (a), we also impose No Anticipation, so cohort 
\begin_inset Formula $E=2000$
\end_inset

 is clearly a Perfect Control Group for the 
\begin_inset Formula $E=1995$
\end_inset

 cohort during the years prior to 
\begin_inset Formula $t=2000$
\end_inset

.
 In Figure (b), we relax No Anticipation for 
\begin_inset Formula $k=2$

 years prior to the event.
 As discussed in the text, this means that cohort 
\begin_inset Formula $E=2000$

 is still a valid control group for the 
\begin_inset Formula $E=1995$
\end_inset

 cohort during the years prior to when anticipation begins in year 
\begin_inset Formula $t=1998=2000-k$

What Can Be Identified with No Restrictions on Anticipation?

\begin_layout Standard
Suppose that winning is anticipated 
\begin_inset Formula $k>0$
\end_inset

 years before it happens.
 The anticipation at 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 means that 
\begin_inset Formula $Y_{t}^{e'}\neq Y_{t}^{\infty}$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $t\geq e'-k$
\end_inset

, so the substitution 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{E}\left[Y_{t}^{{\color{red}\infty}}|E=e'\right]=\mathbb{E}\left[Y_{t}^{{\color{red}e'}}|E=e'\right]$
\end_inset

 is no longer true, so Theorem 1 fails.

\begin_inset Formula $e'=2000$
\end_inset

 is a valid control group for 
\begin_inset Formula $e=1995$
\end_inset

 as long as 
\begin_inset Formula $t<e$
\end_inset

; in particular, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{E}\left[Y_{t}^{\infty}\big|E=2000\right]=\mathbb{E}\left[Y_{t}\big|E=2000\right]=0.75-0.005t$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $-0.005t$
\end_inset

 is the assumed common time trend for all cohorts.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
In Figure 1(b), there is 
\begin_inset Formula $k=2$

 years of anticipation, so

\end_inset

 is a valid control group for 
\begin_inset Formula $e=1995$
\end_inset

 only on 
\begin_inset Formula $t<e'-k$
\end_inset

.
 We can see that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{E}\left[Y_{1999}^{\infty}|E=2000\right]=0.75$
\end_inset

, but 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{E}\left[Y_{1999}|E=2000\right]=0.65$
\end_inset

 due to anticipation, so clearly 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{E}\left[Y_{1999}|E=2000\right]\neq\mathbb{E}\left[Y_{1999}^{\infty}|E=2000\right]$
\end_inset

, so 
\begin_inset Formula $E=2000$
\end_inset

 fails as a control group when 
\begin_inset Formula $t=1999$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As illustrated with the shaded area in Figure 1(b), the 
\begin_inset Formula $E=2000$

 cohort is still a valid control group for the

\begin_inset Formula $t<1998$
\end_inset

, that is, any year prior to when 
\begin_inset Formula $E=2000$
\end_inset

 begins to anticipate treatment.
 This makes clear the cost of having an imperfect control group: we can
 only identify 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathrm{ATT}_{t}$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $t<1998$
\end_inset

 in Figure 1(b), whereas we can identify 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathrm{ATT}_{t}\left(e\right)$
\end_inset

 for

 Because there is No Anticipation, any differences in the trends for cohorts

\begin_inset Formula $e'$

 that we can correct for the differential trends by estimating them in the

 We now show this formally and illustrate it in Figure 2.

So that is the beginning of the analysis – either we start by believing

 we can test/correct for the other.
 This is where choosing the empirical context is important: just as we look

 Clearly, we can't use the approaches above to correct for deviations in
 the pre-trends because there are no deviations in the pre-trends, and we
 can't correct for anticipation because they match perfectly in the years

Regressions with Perfect Control Groups

\begin_layout Subsubsection
1 Treatment Cohort and 1 Control Cohort
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Suppose that any cohort 
\begin_inset Formula $e'>e$
\end_inset

 is a Perfect Control Group for 
\begin_inset Formula $e$
\end_inset

 (that is, it satisfies both Parallel Trends and No Anticipation).
 Since,
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
\mathrm{DiD}_{t,s}(e,e') & \equiv\left(\mathbb{E}\left[Y_{it}\big|E_{i}=e\right]-\mathbb{E}\left[Y_{is}\big|E_{i}=e\right]\right)-\left(\mathbb{E}\left[Y_{it}\big|E_{i}=e'\right]-\mathbb{E}\left[Y_{is}\big|E_{i}=e'\right]\right)
\end{align*}

\end_inset

It is easy to show that, if we estimate the following regression,
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
Y_{it}=\alpha(e,e')+\delta(e,e')1_{t}+\tau(e,e')1_{e}+\gamma_{t,s}(e,e')1_{t}1_{e}+\epsilon_{it},\;\mathit{for}\;E_{i}\in\left\{ e,e'\right\} \;\mathit{and}\;s<e\leq t<e'
\]

\end_inset

then OLS returns 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma_{t,s}(e,e')=\mathrm{DiD}_{t,s}(e,e')$
\end_inset

.
 If 
\begin_inset Formula $e'$
\end_inset

 is a Perfect Control Group for 
\begin_inset Formula $e$
\end_inset

, it follows that 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma_{t,s}(e,e')=\mathit{ATT}_{t}(e)$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection

 Control Cohorts
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Suppose we have cohorts 
\begin_inset Formula $e<e'<e''$
\end_inset

.
 Then, we can write,
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
Y_{it} & =\alpha(e,e')+\delta(e,e')1_{t}+\tau(e,e')1_{e}+\gamma_{t,s}(e,e')1_{t}1_{e}+\epsilon_{it},\;\mathit{for}\;E_{i}\in\left\{ e,e'\right\} \;\mathit{and}\;s<e\leq t<e'\\
Y_{it} & =\alpha(e,e'')+\delta(e,e'')1_{t}+\tau(e,e'')1_{e}+\gamma_{t,s}(e,e'')1_{t}1_{e}+\epsilon_{it},\;\mathit{for}\;E_{i}\in\left\{ e,e''\right\} \;\mathit{and}\;s<e\leq t<e''
\end{align*}

\end_inset

If both 
\begin_inset Formula $e$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $e'$
\end_inset

 are Perfect Control Groups at the same 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

, then 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma_{t,s}(e,e')=\gamma_{t,s}(e,e'')$
\end_inset

.
 For the years satisfying 
\begin_inset Formula $s<e\leq t<e'<e''$
\end_inset

 (so that 
\begin_inset Formula $e'$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $e''$
\end_inset

 are both valid control groups for 
\begin_inset Formula $e$
\end_inset

), we can recover 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma_{t,s}$
\end_inset

 in a single regression with both control cohorts by 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

stacking
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 them into a single equation as follows:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
Y_{it} & =\alpha(e,\{e',e''\})+\delta(e,\{e',e''\})1_{t}+\tau(e,\{e',e''\})1_{e}+\gamma_{t,s}(e,\{e',e''\})1_{t}1_{e}+\epsilon_{it},\;\mathit{for}\;E_{i}\in\left\{ e,e',e''\right\} \;\mathit{and}\;s<e\leq t<e'<e''
\end{align*}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The stacked regression says that, during the years 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 in which both 
\begin_inset Formula $e'$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $e''$
\end_inset

 are control groups, we can use both 
\begin_inset Formula $e'$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $e''$
\end_inset

 when estimating the parameters.
 The 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta_{t}$
\end_inset

 will use all 3 cohorts to estimate the year effect; the 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta_{e}$
\end_inset

 cohort will be the average difference at 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset

 between cohort 
\begin_inset Formula $e$
\end_inset

 and the other two cohorts (weighted by number of observations for each
 of the other two cohorts); and 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma_{t,s}$
\end_inset

 will pick up the DiD estimator of the form,
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
\mathrm{DiD}_{t,s}(e,\{e',e''\}) & \equiv\left(\mathbb{E}\left[Y_{it}\big|E_{i}=e\right]-\mathbb{E}\left[Y_{is}\big|E_{i}=e\right]\right)-\left(\mathbb{E}\left[Y_{it}\big|E_{i}=e'\;\mathit{or}\;E_{i}=e''\right]-\mathbb{E}\left[Y_{is}\big|E_{i}=e'\;\mathit{or}\;E_{i}=e''\right]\right)
\end{align*}

\end_inset

where all that has changed is that the conditioning set for the second differenc
e includes both cohorts 
\begin_inset Formula $e'$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $e''$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that, under the assumptions, having more control cohorts improves precision
 of the estimator by increasing sample size, but does not affect identification.
 Note also that the control groups available for different 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 times will vary.
 For example, if the data is from 2001-2006 and 
\begin_inset Formula $e=2003$
\end_inset

, then cohorts 
\begin_inset Formula $e'\in\left\{ 2004,2005,2006\right\} $
\end_inset

 will be available for 
\begin_inset Formula $t=2003$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $e'\in\left\{ 2005,2006\right\} $
\end_inset

 will be available for 
\begin_inset Formula $t=2004$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $e'=2006$
\end_inset

 will be available for 
\begin_inset Formula $t=2005$
\end_inset

.
 If the pre-period is 
\begin_inset Formula $s=2001$
\end_inset

, then all of these control cohorts 
\begin_inset Formula $e'\in\left\{ 2004,2005,2006\right\} $
\end_inset

 are available for the pre-period.
 This means it is important to be careful to use the same cohorts that are
 available at 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 when estimating the mean at 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset

; otherwise, the difference 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(\mathbb{E}\left[Y_{it}\big|E_{i}=e'\;\mathit{or}\;E_{i}=e''\right]-\mathbb{E}\left[Y_{is}\big|E_{i}=e'\;\mathit{or}\;E_{i}=e''\right]\right)$
\end_inset

 will be affected by composition changes between 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 rather than only by the time effects this term is meant to capture.
 This is done mechanically by including intercepts for each cohort.

 Control Cohorts
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Notice that, when there are two control cohorts, there are also two treatment
 cohorts, since the middle cohort can be used both as a treated and control
 cohort.
 Let's consider the simplest case where 
\begin_inset Formula $e=e'-1=e''-2$
\end_inset

 so that 
\begin_inset Formula $e,e',e''$
\end_inset

 are each in adjacent years.
 Then, 
\begin_inset Formula $e''$
\end_inset

 can be used twice as a control group – it can be the control group for
 
\begin_inset Formula $e$
\end_inset

 both at 
\begin_inset Formula $t=e$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $t=e'$
\end_inset

, and as the control group for 
\begin_inset Formula $e'$
\end_inset

 at 
\begin_inset Formula $t=e'$
\end_inset

.
 Let's focus on 
\begin_inset Formula $t=e$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $s<e$
\end_inset

:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
Y_{it} & =\alpha(e,\{e',e''\})+\delta(e,\{e',e''\})1_{t=e}+\tau(e,\{e',e''\})1_{e}+\gamma_{t=e,s}(e,\{e',e''\})1_{t=e}1_{e}+\epsilon_{it},\;\mathit{for}\;E_{i}\in\left\{ e,e',e''\right\} \;\mathit{and}\;t\in\left\{ s,e\right\} \\
Y_{it} & =\alpha(e',e'')+\delta(e',e'')1_{t=e+1}+\tau(e',e'')1_{e+1}+\gamma_{t=e+1,s}(e',e'')1_{t=e+1}1_{e'}+\epsilon_{it},\;\mathit{for}\;E_{i}\in\left\{ e',e''\right\} \;\mathit{and}\;t\in\left\{ s,e+1\right\} 
\end{align*}

\end_inset

The first equation identifies 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathit{ATT}_{t=e}(e)$
\end_inset

 when pooling the 
\begin_inset Formula $e',e''$
\end_inset

 cohorts as control groups.
 The last equation identifies 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma_{t=e+1,s}(e',e'')=\mathit{ATT}_{t=e+1}(e')$
\end_inset

 using the 
\begin_inset Formula $e''$
\end_inset

 cohort as the control group.
 Importantly, the control group in the first equation 
\begin_inset Formula $e'$
\end_inset

 is the treatment group in the second equation.

 As an alternative, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 propose a regression approach that does not require stacking, but instead
 relies on using a single control cohort (the cohort with the latest treatment
 onset time) to identify all cohort-specific ATT effects.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 In the first equation, 
\begin_inset Formula $r=e$
\end_inset

 is the reference cohort for both 
\begin_inset Formula $e'$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $e''$
\end_inset

.
 In the second equation, 
\begin_inset Formula $r=e'$
\end_inset

 is the reference cohort for 
\begin_inset Formula $e''$
\end_inset

.
 So there are two copies of the 
\begin_inset Formula $e'$
\end_inset

 observation, but one is coded with 
\begin_inset Formula $r=e$
\end_inset

 and the other is coded with 
\begin_inset Formula $r=e'$
\end_inset

.
 Then, to estimate 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma_{t=e,s}(e,\{e',e''\})$
\end_inset

, we fully interact the regression that uses 
\begin_inset Formula $e$
\end_inset

 as the treatment group and 
\begin_inset Formula $e',e''$
\end_inset

 as the control groups with an indicator 
\begin_inset Formula $1_{r=e}$
\end_inset

, and to estimate 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma_{t=e+1,s}(e',e'')$
\end_inset

, we fully interact the regression that uses 
\begin_inset Formula $e'$
\end_inset

 as the treatment group and 
\begin_inset Formula $e''$
\end_inset

 as the control group with an indicator 
\begin_inset Formula $1_{r=e'}$
\end_inset

.
 Then, we can estimate both regressions simultaneously, since they are fully
 interacted with the 
\begin_inset Formula $1_{r}$
\end_inset

 indicators so that it is equivalent to estimating the two regressions separatel
y.
 Given the stacked representation with reference cohort interactions, we
 can consider the following assumption:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\bar under
Definition: Homogeneous ATT in Event Time:
\bar default
 We say the 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathrm{ATT}$
\end_inset

 is homogeneous in event time if 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathrm{ATT}_{t}\left(e\right)=\mathrm{ATT}_{t'}\left(e'\right)=\overline{\mathrm{ATT}}_{\mathit{post}}$
\end_inset

 , for all 
\begin_inset Formula $e,e',t,t'$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathit{post}\equiv e'-e$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $t'\equiv t+\mathit{post}$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To impose homogeneity in our regression representation, we want 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma_{t=e,s}(e,\{e',e''\})=\gamma_{t=e+1,s}(e',e'')$
\end_inset

, but we still want to allow for 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta(e,\{e',e''\})\neq\delta(e',e'')$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau(e,\{e',e''\})\neq\tau(e',e'')$
\end_inset

.
 This is easy in our reference-cohort representation: we simply drop the
 interaction with 
\begin_inset Formula $1_{r}$
\end_inset

 with each of the 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$
\end_inset

 terms so that the regression will force 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma_{t=e,s}(e,\{e',e''\})=\gamma_{t=e+1,s}(e',e'')$
\end_inset

.
 This is equivalent to a GMM estimator where we estimate the first regression
 separately from the second regression, but impose a penalty on deviations
 from 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma_{t=e,s}(e,\{e',e''\})=\gamma_{t=e+1,s}(e',e'')$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This extends to the general case: we can always account for 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

 treatment cohorts and 
\begin_inset Formula $M$
\end_inset

 control cohorts by reframing it as each 1 treatment cohort matched to as
 many control cohorts as possible for each outcome time 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

, then fully interacting each of these regressions with the treatment reference
 cohort indicator 
\begin_inset Formula $1_{r}$
\end_inset

.
 We present the general case in 
\series bold
\bar under
Figure 4
\series default
\bar default
.
 Here, we simulate data from a model with dynamic ATTs (across event time)
 that are homogeneous (across cohorts).
 The Perfect Control Group assumption is satisfied.
 We compare estimates when allowing for heterogeneity across cohorts, the
 Pooled estimate when imposing homogeneity in the estimator, and also compare
 these to the standard DiD estimator that does not use stacking.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We see that the true values are well recovered by the Pooled and Standard
 DiD estimators, with some evidence that the Pooled standard errors are
 tighter due to using more control observations in the central event times.
 By contrast, the cohort-specific estimates are substantially more noisy
 with larger standard errors, illustrating the benefit of imposing homogeneity
 when the true model is homogeneous.

 Control Cohorts: No Anticipation Holds, but Trends are not Parallel
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Suppose that we are in the case where for all cohorts, No Anticipation holds,
 however Parallel Trends does not hold.
 As demonstrated in Figure 2, if the precise form of the deviation from
 parallel trends, 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi_{t,s}\left(e,e'\right)$
\end_inset

, is known, we could directly remove the bias due to differing parallel
 trends from each observation of unit 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 at time 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 and proceed as in Section 3.1.3.
 However, in practice, 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi_{t,s}\left(e,e'\right)$
\end_inset

 is unknown.
 Nonetheless, for a given parametric form, we may use the pre-treatment
 observations 
\begin_inset Formula $t<e$
\end_inset

 for each cohort to identify the cohort-specific components of the trend
 (under the assumption that the pre-treatment trend continues unchanged
 post-treatment).
 Then, by residualizing the outcome 
\begin_inset Formula $Y_{it}$
\end_inset

 with respect to the recovered trend component, we again regain Parallel
 Trends and are back in the case in Section 3.1.3.
 For example, suppose that the underlying deviation from parallel trends
 is cohort-specific linear trends.
 For exposition, let 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{min}$
\end_inset

 denote each unit 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

's earliest calendar time observation.
 To adjust for cohort-specific linear trends, we first restrict the sample
 to observations 
\begin_inset Formula $t<e$
\end_inset

 and consider the following regression:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
Y_{it} & =\alpha+\psi_{e}1_{e}(t-t_{min})+\epsilon_{it},\;\mathit{for}\;\;t<e\\
\end{align*}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Next, we use the recovered slope parameters 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi_{e}$
\end_inset

 from the above regression to construct the trend contribution to each 
\begin_inset Formula $Y_{it}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{Y_{it}}=\psi_{e}(t-t_{min})$
\end_inset

.
 Finally, we produce residualized outcome data 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{Y_{it}}$
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula $\equiv Y_{it}-\tilde{Y_{it}}$
\end_inset

.
 Under the joint assumptions that the deviation from parallel trends takes
 a cohort-specific linear form and that this trend persists post-treatment,
 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{Y_{it}}$
\end_inset

 would now satisfy both No Anticipation and Parallel Trends and we can proceed
 with the approach in Section 3.1.3.

We ignore discussion of inference, however, given that this strategy would
 rely on pre-estimated pre-trend parameters, one would want standard errors
 on estimated ATT parameters to reflect this pre-estimation.

Figure 5

 demonstrates the correction for non-parallel trends with stacked data.
 In Figure 5(a), we show how biased the estimators are when Parallel Trends
 fails in a linear way.
 In Figure 5(b), we correct the stacked estimators using the two-step approach
 where we fit time-trends on pre-treatment data and then extrapolate those
 trends on post-treatment time periods in order to residualize out the time
 trends.
 In the Standard DiD estimator, we include linear cohort-specific time-trends
 in the regression.
 We see that the corrections generally perform well, though standard DiD
 is affected by large standard errors.

 Treatment Cohorts and

\end_inset

 Control Cohorts: Parallel Trends Holds, but there is Anticipation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Suppose that we are in the case where for all cohorts, Parallel Trends holds,
 but No Anticipation does not hold; that is, for each treated cohort with
 onset time 
\begin_inset Formula $e$
\end_inset

, individuals begin adjusting their outcome in anticipation of treatment
 as of period 
\begin_inset Formula $e-k$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $k>0$
\end_inset

.
 As discussed in Section 2.1.1, for a given cohort 
\begin_inset Formula $e,$
\end_inset

 anticipation is analogous to moving the treatment onset time for all later
 cohorts 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 periods into the future.
 This mapping suggests how we adjust the approach in Section 3.1.3 for a given
 anticipation period - when stacking control observations for a given reference
 cohort 
\begin_inset Formula $r=e,$
\end_inset

 only use 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{i}\in\{e'\,|\,e'>e+k\}$
\end_inset

.
 For example, consider the case with with five adjacent cohorts, i.e., 
\begin_inset Formula $e=e'-1=e''-2=e'''-3=e''''-4$
\end_inset

 and suppose 
\begin_inset Formula $k=2$
\end_inset

, meaning that all cohorts begin adjusting their outomc in anticipation
 of being treated two periods prior to treatment onset.
 Unlike in Section 3.1.3, for 
\begin_inset Formula $t=e$
\end_inset

, we could no longer include 
\begin_inset Formula $\{e',e''\}$
\end_inset

 in the set of control groups.
 Thus, for the reference cohort 
\begin_inset Formula $r=e,$
\end_inset

 the underlying regression for the 
\begin_inset Formula $r=e$
\end_inset

 subsample would now be
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
Y_{it} & =\alpha(e,\{e''',e''''\})+\delta(e,\{e''',e''''\})1_{t=e}+\tau(e,\{e''',e''''\})1_{e}+\gamma_{t=e,s}(e,\{e''',e''''\})1_{t=e}1_{e}+\epsilon_{it},\\
 & \;\mathit{for}\;E_{i}\in\left\{ e,e''',e''''\right\} \;\mathit{and}\;t\in\left\{ s,e\right\} 
\end{align*}

\end_inset

Otherwise, the approach to recover the identified ATT effects proceeds as
 in Section 3.1.3.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In 
\series bold
\bar under
Figure 6
\series default
\bar default
, we introduce 
\begin_inset Formula $k=2$
\end_inset

 periods of anticipation.
 Figure 6(a) demonstrates the bias in the estimators when not accounting
 for this anticipation.
 Note that, as long as the reference event time is prior to anticipation
 (event time -3 in the figure), the standard DiD performs well with anticipation.
 In Figure 6(b), we correct for anticipation in the stacked estimators by
 limiting which control cohorts are used to be at least two cohorts ahead.
 As a result, we cannot estimate as many effects across event times.
 Note: Standard DiD would be able to correct for anticipation if anticipation
 were homogeneous across cohorts, as Standard DiD implicitly includes a
 correction for homogeneous anticipation.

Stacking/Correcting the Data

\size footnotesize

omitted_event_time = -2

\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
You can set a minimum gap before using a control cohort (to correct for
 anticipation) by setting, for example, 
\size footnotesize
\color blue
min_control_gap = 3
\size default
\color inherit

\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
You can also set a maximum control cohort, e.g., FN use 5 cohorts ahead only,
 which you can do in our command by setting 
\size footnotesize

min_control_gap = 5
\size default
\color inherit
 and 
\size footnotesize
\color blue
max_control_gap = 5
\size default

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, to correct for linear deviations from Parallel Trends, simply do
 this before running ES_clean_data:

data = ES_parallelize_trends(data)

\begin_layout Subsection*
ATT Estimation

results = ES_estimate_ATT(stacked_data, homogeneous_ATT = FALSE, omitted_event_t
ime = -2)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
where 
\size footnotesize
\color blue
homogeneous_ATT=TRUE
\size default

 would instead impose homogeneity and the omitted event time should be set
